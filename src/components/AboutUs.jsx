            Hi, I'm Mustaqeem, the founder of MohShop. Hailing from Haryana, I
            embarked on this journey in March 2021. The initial days were
            challenging, but I held firm to the belief that with dedication and
            perseverance, MohShop would emerge as one of the leading businesses
            in our country.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are a local e-commerce company committed to creating a
            sustainable business that fosters inclusive and impactful growth for
            all our partners. We embrace transformative innovation and aren't
            afraid to take risks. Instead of shying away from failure, we see it
            as an opportunity to learn. Our goal is to enhance customer
            experiences and bridge the gap between Bharat and India through
            digital commerce.
